> _BEFORE YOU CLICK AWAY, AT LEAST READ THIS_: Do you like you free stuff? There's a free shirt available right now if you register and complete 5 pull request's (herein referred to as PR's). This is pretty straightforward for the average programmer/open source user (if you're making regular PR's you might be able to get this shirt just by registering in 5 clicks or less). However, if you are neither of those and are more like me this time last year, you're curious how to get that free shirt but really intimidated about the idea of contributing to open source. That's okay, we all start somewhere. Hopefully this is your start, because Hacktoberfest really is an awesome opportunity to do so.

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), sponsored by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com), [Github](https://github.com), and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) is currently underway and the response has been amazing! If you're not familiar with Hacktoberfest, the brief rundown would basically be an event that runs the entirety of October and typically requires the developer to make a certain amount of pull requests to be locked in for a prize of some form. For this Hacktoberfest, the prize is a shirt and I believe some stickers if you register but do not reach the 5 pull request's requirement. If you haven't seen the shirt, here it is:

Yeah, that's a really nice shirt to get for free, and yes, this is a global event and the international shipping is free too! So now that you have the **what**, I imagine you'd like to know the **how** as well.

# Step 1: Get registered on the Hacktoberfest site!

> Navigate to [the main Hacktoberfest site](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and you'll be greeted with a site like this:

<img width="200" alt="portfolio_view" src="https://github.com/jayyargh/Writing/blob/master/Medium/Hacktoberfest/hacktober-register.png">

> Your next objective is to "Start Hacking", which will take you to a page that prompts you to "Register". Upon clicking this, you'll be prompted to link up your Github (this is your reminder to make sure you're registered on Github if you haven't already!) and once done, you're all set! Head back to the main Hacktoberfest page and instead of "Start Hacking" you'll be able to check your progress which will show you your progress towards the shirt, a neat chart with all of your PR's that count, and below that, global stats for the entire Hacktoberfest event.

As of right now, there are 23,000+ people who have completed the event with their 5 PR's. I believe the first 50k people will receive shirts, which is an astronomical number of shirts to send out. Now, moving steadily along...

# Step 2: You're registered and linked to Github, now what?

> I am going to post a list of the most popular repos being contributed for the event as well as some others, including one that is specifically designed for someone who has NEVER made a PR before. This repo will explain the entire process, walk you through it and upon completion you'll be 1/5 of the way to your shirt! This repo is only for first time open source contributors though! So you'll need some other repos to contribute to to get your remaining 4 PR's.

> So your strategy will be to click the link to the repo of your choice and read through it. Many repos attempt to adhere to high standards of quality. However, there are times when grammar/spelling errors slip through, sections of documentation are incomplete (sometimes called stubs), or perhaps entirely missing. This is your opportunity to rectify the situation. So, you will go to the top right of the repo, and "fork" it. This makes a copy of everything in it and places it under your profile within your care. At this point, you may use the in-browser editor to make any changes necessary, or clone it down to your computer and make changes within your text editor of choice. If you unfamiliar with this process, you may check out this resource: [This guide also lists another repo you could perhaps make another PR for!](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife)

1. [First Contributions: Your first open source contribution repo](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) (This is a very comprehensive guide of the entire process from start to finish)
2. [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) (If you are interested in learning how to code, this is an excellent resource you should know about regardless!)
3. [JSON Movie Collection](https://github.com/jsonmc/jsonmc) (Another very popular option)
4. [Make a PR: Student's Database](https://github.com/rishabh-bansal/Make-a-Pull-Request) (This is another easy one for Hacktoberfest)
5. [Al-go-rithms: A great resource for learning algorithms as well!](https://github.com/ZoranPandovski/al-go-rithms) (Are you a programmer? Interested in sharing/learning new data structures and algorithms? This is an excellent resource for you then!)

There you go! 5 really easy resources that anyone can contribute to for a quick PR to get their shirt this month! If you need any more, there is a comprehensive list of the top PR-submitted-to-repos during Hacktoberfest in your progress dashboard on the main site.

# Step 3: Wait, you want more?

Alright, fine. This one isn't really a step per se, but by this point you should have everything you need to be styling and profiling in your new hacker shirt. But maybe you want... _two shirts_? Or something else entirely? Good, we're on the same page. Microsoft is doing a Hacktoberfest event as well and giving away their own super cool t-shirt! You can find the details for that [here](https://open.microsoft.com/2018/09/30/join-hacktoberfest-2018-celebration-microsoft/). In addition, [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2018-has-arrived/) is all aboard with giving away an awesome shirt too! Use the skills you attained in the two steps above and utilize them on the Microsoft and SendGrid repo's. Go make me proud and monopolize on the most wonderful time of the year, getting free shirts for putting bytes of information on the internet!

> With all of these shirts, my wardrobe will have almost tripled!
